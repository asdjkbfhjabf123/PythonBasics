You are creating a fantasy video game.
The data structure to model the player’s inventory will be a dictionary where the keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing how many of that item the player has. 

For example, the dictionary value {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12} means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.


Write a function named displayInventory() that would take any possible “inventory” and display it like the following:
Inventory:
12 arrow
42 gold coin
1 rope
6 torch
1 dagger
Total number of items: 62


Hint: You can use a for loop to loop through all the keys in a dictionary.

# inventory.py
stuff = {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12}
def displayInventory(inventory):
 print("Inventory:")
 item_total = 0
 for k, v in inventory.items():
 # FILL THIS PART IN
 print("Total number of items: " + str(item_total))
displayInventory(stuff)

Ans>
displayinventory = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']

#starting inventory (given as dictionary in the assignment)
inventory = {
  'rope': 1,
  'torch': 6,
  'gold coin': 42,
  'dagger': 1,
  'arrow': 12
}

#function to print inventory, including total items no.
def display_inventory(lst):
  total_items = 0
  for i in lst:
    print(str(lst[i]) + " " + str(i))
    total_items += lst[i]
  print ("Total number of items: " + (str(total_items)))
display_inventory(inventory)

#function to add new item set to inventory: The first part is to change the list of loot to a dictionary, the second is to either add the amount to the items already in inventory, or to add the key value pair altogether. The last part isto print current inventory just like the function before

#to get an empty space in the output
print

def add_to_inventory(inv, added_items):
  added_itemsQ = {}
  total_items = 0
  for item in added_items:
    added_itemsQ[item] = 1
  for i in added_itemsQ:
    if not i in inv:
      inv[i] = added_itemsQ[i]
    else:
      inv[i] = inv[i] + added_itemsQ[i]
  for i in inv:
    print(str(inv[i]) + " " + str(i))
    total_items += inv[i]
  print ("Total number of items: " + (str(total_items)))

add_to_inventory(inventory, displayinventory)

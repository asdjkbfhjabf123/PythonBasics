Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it in the interactive shell.

Ans> name="Rakesh";
	len(x);	op=6
So len() calculates the characters in a string.

Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.

Ans> no=78.963
	round(no);	op=79
So round() rounds the no by considering the nos present after decimal.
	abs(no);	op=78.963
abs() gives an absolute value of the no.
